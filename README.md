# EXP-3-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
1.	Define scope & dataset
 o	Choose use cases (e.g., summarization, technical Q&A).
 o	Prepare a prompt set (N prompts per use case). Ensure variety, difficulty levels, and ground-truth where applicable.
2.	Define evaluation rubric
 o	Metrics: Accuracy (factual), Relevance, Clarity, Completeness/Depth, Conciseness, Safety/No-hallucination.
 o	Scoring scale: e.g., 1–5 for each metric.
3.	Generate outputs
 o	For each platform P and each prompt i, send prompt and collect response R_{P,i}.
 o	Record metadata: timestamp, model version, prompt template, parameters (temperature, max tokens).
4.	Human & automated evaluation
 o	Prepare blind evaluation sheets (remove platform labels).
 o	Have k human raters score each (or use automated checks for things like length, grammar, factual overlap).
 o	Compute inter-rater reliability (Cronbach’s alpha or Fleiss’ kappa).
5.	Aggregate scores
 o	For each (P, prompt), compute mean metric scores across raters.
 o	For each platform P, compute overall mean scores (per metric and weighted composite).
6.	Statistical testing
 o	Test for significance across platforms: repeated-measures ANOVA or Friedman test (non-parametric) depending on data distribution.
 o	If significant, perform pairwise comparisons (paired t-test with Bonferroni or Wilcoxon signed-rank).
7.	Qualitative analysis
 o	Collect representative good / bad outputs per platform.
 o	Note systematic behaviours (verbosity, hallucination patterns, formatting).
8.	Reporting
 o	Produce tables, radar charts, and per-use-case breakdowns.
 o	Provide recommendations and limitations.

Prompt:
“What is the role of power electronics in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems?”
________________________________________
ChatGPT Output:
Power electronics enable bidirectional energy conversion between EV batteries and the power grid in V2G systems. They manage charging (grid-to-vehicle) and discharging (vehicle-to-grid) efficiently. Additionally, they ensure voltage regulation, power factor correction, and system protection for grid stability.
Result: Excellent – detailed, accurate, clear.
________________________________________
Claude Output:
In V2G, power electronics control energy flow between the grid and EV batteries. They allow both charging and discharging, while also handling conversion, safety, and efficiency. Without them, reliable integration of EVs into the grid would not be possible.
Result: Very Good – concise but accurate.
________________________________________
Bard Output:
Power electronics help V2G systems by allowing cars to charge and discharge. They make sure energy is safe and efficient. This helps balance the grid.
Result: Fair – correct but oversimplified.
________________________________________
Cohere Command Output:
Power electronics are the backbone of V2G technology, providing bidirectional conversion between DC (battery) and AC (grid). They handle switching, protection, and optimization to ensure that EVs can serve as grid resources.
Result: Good – technically sound, slight jargon.
________________________________________
Meta Output:
V2G systems use power electronics to move electricity between cars and the grid. They handle charging, discharging, and conversion.
Result: Average – correct but minimal depth.
